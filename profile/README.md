## Description

You work as a scientist in an isolated research lab in the mountains of Switzerland. Your task is to gather signals from space, analyze them, process them, and sell them to get points.

You can get regular signals and objects like dwarf planets and stars, or you can get something "unusual" or even "strange" and "unexplainable".

The game features:
*   40+ days and unique events
*   150+ unique signals
*   Plenty of secrets, mysteries, and easter eggs.

## Quick FAQ

**Q: Will there be multiplayer in the future?**
**A:** Most likely not, due to a lack of networking experience and no foundation for netcode in the game.

**Q: Why does the game use so many resources?**
**A:** This might be caused by the "Volumetric Light" setting. Disable it and performance should improve. You can also lower shadows, effects, and draw distance. However, setting shadows to 0 is not recommended if you want a decent picture.

**Q: How do I use custom content (pictures, radio, TV, etc.)?**
**A:** There are entries for these in the Help section in the main/pause menu. The asset folder is located at `appdata\local\votv\assets`. If you can't see the folder, run the game As Administrator and it will generate the folder.

**Q: All my settings are at 0; Quality is super pixelated; I have a completely black/gray screen.**
**A:** Go to **Settings > Game** and click the **"Regenerate data.sav"** button.

**Q: I don't understand [X thing].**
**A:** Go to the main menu/pause menu and click the **"Help"** button to open the Help window. You can look up the issue you are having.

**Q: Will the game be on Steam one day?**
**A:** The game will come to Steam eventually. However, it is still quite unfinished, so it will take some time to polish it for a Steam release.
